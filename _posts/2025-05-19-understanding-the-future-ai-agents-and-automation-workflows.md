## This should help you understand the differenced between AI Agents & automation workflows (they are complimentary)<br/>

I’ve been digging into the different AI agents currently avaible - Auto-GPT, AgentGPT, LangChain, all that stuff. 

At first glance, they seem like the future: smart, autonomous little bots that can browse the web, plan tasks, and “think” their way through problems.

*But here’s the catch 22: they’re clever, but not very reliable.*

Agents today are slow, they get stuck and are expensive to run. Great for research or prototyping. Not great if you need consistent results every day.

On the flip side, you’ve got tools like n8n - workflow automation with triggers, webhooks, APIs, and now even GPT built in. These are less autonomous, but more stable table, repeatable, and super useful.

**The sweet spot?**

- Use AI agents to think (e.g., generate ideas, make decisions)

- Use n8n to do (e.g., send emails, update sheets, post content)

You can even plug agents into n8n with HTTP requests or the new “AI Agent” node.

So yeah - agents might be the future, but automation featuring AI Agent intergration (a combo of both) is the present. I am certianly utilising both.

## That's all, folks!
