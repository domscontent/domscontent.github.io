A webhook allows a third party app to notifiy n8n on a trigger, anywhere there is not a native api credential

On n8n select a webhook node and view the 'Test URL' or 'Production URL'

Copy and paste this into the third party back end, where there is a field for a webhook event

These are now connected, when this event is complted, the third party will send a notification to the webhook url, provided by n8n

(this is just a trigger, and the webhook does not send any value)

one step further, to then recieve a value, you need to use a HTTP request node in n8n, with the API ur;, and the unique API key

now the data can be recievd back to n8n, from the API key
