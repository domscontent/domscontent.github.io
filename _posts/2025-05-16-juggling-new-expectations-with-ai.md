## AI has meant marketers can do more, but have we really had a head start?...<br/>

The utility of AI and LLM's in my workflow as a marketing executive is massive.

Obviously since the means of outputting content , as well as ideation has become 100x easier and faster, the pressure to deliver more than ever.

### Learning to use AI and LLM's, whilst also being expected to already know what to do

Unless you have a degree in computer science, ultimately anyone trying to play catch up with AI and LLM's has quite a steep learning curve to truely understand the utility of these new tools, in a way that truely frees up resource and optimises manual tasks, also opening the door to advanced optimisation.

Whilst now I am juggiling the expectation for increased output, and learning to not cringe at the untrained 'vibe marketers', using AI and LLM's to content market (instead of picking up the phone), and also subconciously sensing they have some expertise in said tasks, I am also trying to be proactive and learn the next step on from just manually using AI and LLM's:

### Agentic AI (the saving grace)

This is where I find a beam of hope, if I can just focus my attention on automation programmes, such as n8n, then I will be able to regain some resource, and begin to focus on quality, over quantity once again.

So this is what I am doing. Juggling, not get credit for the work and concentration, but as I master n8n, I hope this will all pay off.

My virtual private server is live, and whilst I begin to build agentic AI workflows, I hope my dreams of automation of the mundain will pay off. If not atleast I will be able to take my new skill elsewhere. Suckas.
