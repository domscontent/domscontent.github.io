## About Dom's Content

**Hey. My name’s Dom.** 

I am a b2b marketer by day, and a busy rookie dad by night. I'm from the UK, in southern england. 

*This is my digital diary, a personal development log, and a place to share what I’m learning.*

**You’ll find a mix of content here:**
- Updates about what I’m learning or testing
- Experiments with marketing automation, AI tools, and more
- A growing portfolio of client services I offer for founders and small teams

*You can watch the latest on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@doms-content) at Dom’s Content, or access all my exclusive resources, guides and video content on my [**Patreon**](https://patreon.com/domscontent)*

*If you're a founder or business owner looking for practical marketing help, advice on automating business operations, or AI agents, check out my [services](/services) page.* 

I offer LinkedIn ghostwriting and cold email outreach systems that are fast, focused, and human-led (with some help from AI, of course).

I also offer business process automation and AI agent consultation/build services.

Otherwise, thanks for stopping by!
