## About Dom's Content

Hey. My name’s Dom. 

I am a b2b marketer by day, and a busy rookie dad by night.

*This is my digital diary, a personal development log, and a place to share what I’m learning.*

You’ll find a mix of content here:
- Posts about what I’m learning at work or testing on the side
- Experiments with AI tools, content systems, and lead generation
- A growing portfolio of client services I offer for founders and small teams

*You can watch the latest on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@doms-content) at Dom’s Content, and access all my exclusive resources, guides and video content on my [Patreon](https://patreon.com/domscontent)*

If you're a founder, small business owner, or operator looking for *lean, practical marketing help*, check out my [services](/services) page. 

I offer LinkedIn content writing and cold email outreach systems that are fast, focused, and human-led (with some help from AI, of course).

Otherwise, thanks for stopping by!
