## About

My name’s Dom. This is my digital diary — a personal development log and a place to share what I’m learning.

I am a b2b marketer by day, and a busy rookie dad by night.

You’ll find a mix of content here:
- Posts about what I’m learning at work or testing on the side
- Experiments with AI tools, content systems, and lead generation
- A growing portfolio of client services I offer for founders and small teams

If you're a founder, small business owner, or operator looking for **lean, practical marketing help**, check out my [Services](/services) page — I offer LinkedIn content writing and cold email outreach systems that are fast, focused, and human-led (with some help from AI, of course).

Otherwise, thanks for stopping by.  
You can find me on [YouTube at Dom’s Content](https://www.youtube.com/@domscontent) or reach out via [email](domscontent@icloud.com) if you want to connect.
